            I'm a university student who is currently completing my bachelors degree, specializing in web development, user experience, and design systems. 
            Through my studies, Iâ€™ve taken a range of practical, industry-focused courses including Advanced Web Development, UX Design, Mobile Computing, Software Engineering, 
            and Design Systems. These have given me a strong foundation in building responsive, user-friendly websites with clean code and thoughtful design. 
            If you're looking for a website for your small business or portfolio to display your work, I can deliver something that looks professional, runs smoothly, 
            and is tailored to you.
